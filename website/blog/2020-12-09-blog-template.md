title: Blogs on Medium and thank you
---

Hi everyone, 

Thank you for visiting my blog section. I write my blogs and journals on Medium, which can be accessed through this [link](https://medium.com/@buithu1792000).

As this blog section is the last part on my website, I would like to say thank you to everyone who has spent time going through everything I posted here and learned a little bit more about me. I am an undergraduate student and I understand that there are so many things I need to learn in order to become a successful data scientist/machine learning engineer but I am putting effort into learning from different people and resources to expand my knowledge in the field. 

Right now, I am focusing on doing side projects and taking online courses in data science and machine learning. My goals before I graduate are to complete [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning and](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and [Yann LeCun's Deep Learning](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/). I am aiming to complete 2-3 projects in subfields of machine learning such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. As you can see, I am a beginner but I am on my way to achieve my goal - to become a data scientist/machine learning engineer. 

I will continue to update my progress on GitHub and if anyone is interested, please follow and give me feedback/ advice on what I can do to improve. This is a lifelong learning process and I am motivated to keep learning about the tech world. 

Thank you,
Minh Bui
