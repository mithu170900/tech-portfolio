title: Blogs on Medium and thank you
---

Hi everyone, 

Thank you for visiting my blog section. I write my blogs and journals on Medium, which can be accessed through this [link](https://medium.com/@buithu1792000).

As this blog section is the last part on my website, I would like to say thank you to everyone who has spent time going through everything I posted here and learned a little bit more about me. I am an undergraduate student and I understand that there are so many things I need to learn in order to become a successful data scientist/machine learning engineer but I am putting effort into learning from different people and resources to expand my knowledge in the field.
