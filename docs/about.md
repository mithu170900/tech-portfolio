I am currently earning my Bachelor degree in Math and double minors in Computer Science and Economics. I have a strong background in mathematics, particularly in statistics, probability, and interest theory. I am interested in data science and the technical applications of statistics.

I am doing a departmental honors research in statistics. The topic is about measuring elementary school children's reading ability. We use different statistical distributions to measure the measurement errors of each data collection method. This project is in R and will be published.

From my coursework, research experience, and previous internships, I have skills in data science (exploratory data analysis, data wrangling, data cleansing, data entry) and machine learning (classification, predictive modeling) in Python and SQL. I also have skills in applying and researching different statistical methods in R. A more comprehensive list of my expertise and achievements can be found on my resume.
