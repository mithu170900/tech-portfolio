Last summer, I interned as a data scientist at [COUNTRY Financial](https://www.countryfinancial.com/en/about-us/careers.html). I learned a lot about data science and machine learning, especially in predictive modeling. Some of the machine learning algorithms we used were logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost.
